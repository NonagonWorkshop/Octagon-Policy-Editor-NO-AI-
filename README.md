# Octagon Policy Editor

Welcome to Octagon Policy Editor!
Octagon Policy Editor is our recreation of Pollen Policy Editor, Pentagon Policy Editor, and Polygon Policy Editor, it combines the best of all them, except unlike Pollen, Octagon won't remove extensions such as GoGuardian, but rather add them as force-installed extensions. You can always add your own force installed extensions to the script if you need to, or remove them!


**Executing Octagon for temporary use:**

Step 1: Make sure you are in Developer Mode

Step 2: Enter the VT2 Shell (Control + ALT + F2)

Step 3: Login as root

Step 4: Execute the Octagon Policy Editor Command:

```
curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NonagonWorkshop/Octagon-Policy-Editor/refs/heads/main/Octagon.sh | bash
```

NOTE: This is only temporary and the Policy Editor will go away on your next Restart / Reboot (sudo reboot)! 
If you want to make it permanent please proceed the the next set of instructions.

Executing Octagon for permanent use:

Step 1: Make sure you are in Developer Mode

Step 2: Enter the VT2 Shell (Control + ALT + F2)

Step 3: Login is as root

Step 4: Execute the Octagon RootFS Command:

```
curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NonagonWorkshop/Octagon-Policy-Editor/refs/heads/main/OctagonRootfs.sh | bash
```

Once the OctagonRootFS script is executed successfully, reboot your computer (sudo reboot), then head back to the VT2 Shell and execute the Octagon Policy Editor Command.

If you already have RootFS Disabled, then you are not required to run the Octagon RootFS Disabler.
